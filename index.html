        <p>
          wI am a student of class 2026. I'm a cell-like independent teamworker, strong in research and coding.

        <h2 id="projects">PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science is a subject that has always inspired me. I have explored this interest inside and outside the classroom since childhood. I have taken courses in programming languages such as Python, Arduino (C++), CSS, and HTML in the classroom. I always seek opportunities to apply these skills in my daily life. I have also participated in coding and robotics competitions in the past. Outside of the classroom, I am working on a personal project, which is an online squash game. This game employs pose estimation to monitor and identify the players' motions, enabling players to control in-game characters.
